      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players
      console.log(players, team)

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = 'Lux'

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice()

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players)

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]

      const team5 = Array.from(players)

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person
      // captain.number = 99 // will also change the person object

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person)

      // we can also use the object ...spread
      const captain3 = { ...person }
      captain3.age = 99

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const tine = {
        name: 'Tine',
        age: 29,
        social: {
          twitter: '@tine',
          linkedin: '@tiney',

      }

      console.clear()
      console.log(tine)

      const tine2 = { ...tine }
      const tine2 = Object.assign({}, tine)

      // when we do this now it won't affect our original object
      tine2.age = 'wowza'

      // however, if we do the following, it will also change the original object because neither the spread operator nor Object.assign lets you make a copy of nested items
      // tine2.social.twitter = '@coolwoman'
      // console.log(tine.social.twitter) // will print '@coolwoman'

      // the solution? The following is solving this issue, but you should be careful when using it since it can have an impact on performanc
      const tine3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tine))
      tine3.social.twitter = '@superwoman'
      console.log(tine.social.twitter) // will print '@tine' because the original object has not been modified
